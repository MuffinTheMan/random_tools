random_tools
============

A place for me to keep some rather random functions that I have use of for various projects.

* **date_diff.js**  
Currently finds the difference (in months) between two dates (x,y). The difference will be negative if x precedes y.  
Works for any two dates in the format `yyyy[./,-]mm*`  
Example: `2008-09-19 16:48:26`

* **xINy.js**  
A simple function to determine whether or not an element is present in an array of objects. This script is not generic--it only works with a very specific array of specific objects in a private project I am working on. I may make the function more generic in the future, but this gets the job done for my purposes now.

* **toInt.js**  
Very specific function to convert to an integer and return 0 when we get a whacky NaN.

* **xLESSy.js**

* **add_month.js**

* **date_add.js**  
Adds the number of months passed (months) from the date passed (date) and returns the resulting date in yyyy-mm format. If (months) is negative, that number of months will be subtracted from the date (date).

* **date_range.js**  
Dependent on date_diff.js

* **member_for.js**
