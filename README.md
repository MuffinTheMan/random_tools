random_tools
============

A place for me to keep some rather random functions that I have use of for various projects.

* date_diff.js
Currently finds the difference (in months) between two dates (x,y). The difference will be negative if x precedes y.

Works for any two dates in the format `yyyy[./,-]mm*`

// Example: `2008-09-19 16:48:26`

* xINy.js
A simple function to determine whether or not an element is present in an array of objects. This script is not generic--it only works with a very specific array of specific objects in a private project I am working on. I may make the function more generic in the future, but this gets the job done for my purposes now.
